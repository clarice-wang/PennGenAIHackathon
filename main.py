    Below is a historical event you must tell a story about.

    Your goal is to:
    - Write a story about this historical event.
    - If a moment was specified, the story should focus on that particular moment.
    - This story should be factually correct.
    - Tell the story in language suited for the given audience.
    - Separate the story into five main segments, clearly marked by their segment number.

    For example:
    - The event is WWI, the specific moment is 'How It Started', and the target audience is 'Elementary (6-9 years old)'.
    - The story should be about what events led up to WWI, told in very simple sentencing using vocab words easily understood by an elementary school student.
    
    Below is the historical event, specific moment in the event, and target audience:
    EVENT: {event}
    MOMENT: {moment}
    AUDIENCE: {audience}

    YOUR RESPONSE:
